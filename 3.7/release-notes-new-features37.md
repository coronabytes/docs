### Parallel Move Shard

Shards can now move in parallel. The old locking mechanism was replaced by a
read-write lock and thus allows multiple jobs for the same destination server.
The actual transfer rates are still limited on DB-Server side but there is a
huge overall speedup. This also affects `CleanOutServer` and
`ResignLeadership` jobs.
